Basic n-gram model with Laplace smooth is easy to implement\n2. Multi-core can speed the computation \n3. Still need to further divide the data due to memory limit\n\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
