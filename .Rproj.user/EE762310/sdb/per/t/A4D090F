More specifically it combines a 3-gram, a 2-gram and a unigram model with decreasing priority in a prediction process. As an example, it will first invoke the 3gram model with two previous words as key, and then the 2-gram model with one previous word, and finally the unigram model. Then, it will return the 5 most probably words to user.\n\n#### Source code\n\nThis project is 100% open-source. All the source codes are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lifan0127/DSCapstoneProject).\n\n\n\n## Summary & Path forward\n\n* We developed a text prediction model that has great potential for next-generation assistive typing applications on Mobile devices. \n* For demonstration, we built a web-based application that support text prediction evaluation and model visualization.\n* There are ample opportunities for improvement of the statistical model and development of end-use applications.\n* We are currently seeking a partnership that can provide fund to support 3 month full-time development and a dedicated server to launch a public preview version of the application.\n* Thank you!\n\n",
